# Playing with Dapper

- In this repository, there is a Web API for a very simple hotel booking system
- Even though the domain is simplified, it was good to try out certain Dapper features
- There is an implementation of the Unit of Work design pattern to manage transactions between the repositories
- I used Postgres and DbUp for database migration
