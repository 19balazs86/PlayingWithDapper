# Playing with Dapper

- This repository contains a few projects for working with Dapper on PostgreSQL and SQL Server
- Using Dapper definitely makes life easier, especially for mapping entities, but I faced some issues when using it with Postgres. Compared to SQL Server was much smoother

## Projects in the solution

#### `DapperWebApi`

- Simple Web API for a simplified hotel booking system with a minimal business scope
- Unit of Work design pattern is implemented to handle transactions across multiple repositories
- PostgreSQL and DbUp are used for managing database migrations

#### `OutboxProcessorWorker`

- The concept originates from Milan: Outbox message processor designed for high-performance, handling of billions of messages daily
- I adapted the Postgres database solution for use on SQL server
- For the update, with the MERGE INTO statement, I encountered the issue of SQL Server's 2100 parameter limit
- While solving that issue, I realized by using a User-Defined Table Type and Stored Procedure could improve update performance

#### `ConcurrencyControlApp`

- A console application with examples demonstrating **optimistic concurrency** in SQL Server and Postgres using Dapper and Entity Framework
- Both databases have built-in solutions, but they work differently
- SQL Server uses a `ROWVERSION` column for the table, while Postgres has a built-in system column called `xmin`
- The Unit of Work design pattern is implemented in a generic way that can be used for both SQL Server and Postgres to manage transactions across multiple repositories with Dapper
- The built-in solutions work well and require no additional management effort. You could create a uniform solution by using a column like UpdatedAt, but in this case, you would need to manage it yourself. EF can assist with the IsConcurrencyToken flag.
